# Kevala Ceramics Analytics Project

## Project Summary

This project analyzes internal sales, quotation, and customer data from a Bali-based ceramics manufacturer (name withheld for confidentiality) to support international growth through data-driven decision-making.

Using Python and libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `prophet`, the project follows a structured analytics pipeline to explore trends, segment customers, forecast demand, and visualize key business insights.

The analysis was conducted as part of a multi-part applied analytics portfolio series and concludes with an interactive Tableau storyboard highlighting strategic opportunities for expansion and optimization.

## Key Questions

This project seeks to answer the following business-critical questions:

- Which customer types generate the most value, and how can they be segmented?
- How does demand vary by region, customer category, and trade type?
- What are the strongest predictors of total invoice value?
- How are sales distributed geographically, and where are export opportunities emerging?
- What patterns exist in order volume and revenue over time?
- How can the company anticipate demand and better plan production cycles?
